For our electronic lab notebook, we (the cheminfo team at EPFL with the [Laboratory of Molecular Simulation](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsmo/)) are looking for front-end developers that help us improve some tools and interfaces in the ELN.
Ideally, you know JavaScript and React. No knowledge of chemistry is required, but it is a plus.

The timings are flexible (you can work whenever it suits you) as is the scope of the project (i.e., we will discuss with you what a suitable project is). If you are interested, [contact us](/contact), and we can figure out the details. Ideally, you are already a student at EPFL.
